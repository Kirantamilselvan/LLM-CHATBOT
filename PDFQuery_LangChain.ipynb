applications with \\nOmniverse\\n. \\nAnnounced \\nsix new NVIDIA RTX™ GPUs\\n for mobile and desktop workstations based on the Ada architecture.\\nAutomotive\\nFirst-quarter revenue was a record $296 million, up 114% from a year ago and up 1% from the previous quarter.\\nAnnounced that its \\nautomotive design win pipeline\\n has grown to $14 billion over the next six years, up from $11 billion\\na year ago.\\nAnnounced that the world’s leading electric vehicle maker \\nBYD will extend its use of NVIDIA DRIVE Orin™\\n across new\\nmodels.\\nCFO Commentary\\nCommentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at\\nhttps://investor.nvidia.com/\\n.\\nConference Call and Webcast Information\\nNVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2024 financial results and\\ncurrent financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of theconference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, \\nhttps://investor.nvidia.com\\n. The webcast will be\\nrecorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal\\n2024.\\nNon-GAAP Measures\\nTo supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company\\nuses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP\\ngross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other\\nincome (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For\\nNVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a\\nreconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures\\nto exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related\\ncosts, legal settlement costs, other, losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt\\ndiscount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash\\nprovided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments\\non property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures\\nenhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the\\ncompany’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s\\nfinancial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-\\nGAAP measures used by other companies.\\n \\nNVIDIA CORPORATION\\n CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\\n(In millions, except
